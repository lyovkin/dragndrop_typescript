# Reading files in JavaScript using the [File APIs](https://www.w3.org/TR/file-upload/)
### Some interfaces are used to access files on the local file system
1. File - an individual file; provides readonly information such as name, file size, mimetype, and a reference to the file handle.
2. FileList - an array-like sequence of File objects. (Think <input type="file" multiple> or dragging a directory of files from the desktop).
